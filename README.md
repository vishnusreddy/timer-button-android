# Timer Button

## Requirements
- It should start timer when the app requests for it and disable the button till timer completes.
- User should be able to inform from XML layout, if he wants it to be enabled initially or disabled. 
- If enabled, it should be enabled from the beginning and working like a regular button. 
- If disabled, it should be disabled initially, and the timer should start only once the app starts the timer. Once timer is completed, it should be possible for the button to be clicked. 
- Proper handling of cases where the user exits the app/reopens and stuff needs special handling. In V1, we can choose to ignore this.
